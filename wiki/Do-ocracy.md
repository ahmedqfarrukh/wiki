Do-ocracy
=========

Typically when someone wants to do or change something big at the Red Mountain Makerspace, they bring it up at a meeting and/or discuss it on the mailing list. Most of the time many of us just don't want to be troubled with spending a week figuring out if everyone is ok with a small or mundane thing, and so there's Do-ocracy. Do-ocracy tends to work just as long as our only rule is followed, don't be an asshole. If yall need more direction try to instead, [be excellent to each other](Be-excellent-to-each-other "Be excellent to each other").

**Do-ocracy: If you want something done, do it, but remember to be excellent to each other when doing so.**

Notes
-----

*   Do-ocracy works most of the time. When it doesn't it REALLY sucks.
*   If someone nicely asks you to change something back, be nice back and just change it back.
*   If someone's being a dick to you about something you've changed, be nice and just change it back. If you must cry about it only do so after you've restored things.
