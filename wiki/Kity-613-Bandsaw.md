## Cutting Straight Lines Using a Band Saw

Want to cut a straight line with your band saw? Follow these steps:

1.  Before making any cuts, set the blade guard to be about ½ inch above the stock.
2.  Each time you change the blade you’ll have to verify that it cuts parallel to the fence.
3.  Grab a 2-foot-long piece of scrap with a line drawn down its middle parallel to one edge.
4.  Cut that line by eye as well as you can.
5.  When the scrap is aligned correctly with the blade, you’ll feel that you’re cutting straight without having to make big adjustments.
6.  Stop, and holding the workpiece to the table, turn off the saw.
7.  When the blade stops moving, mark the table with a pencil along the edge of the scrap piece.
8.  Loosen the bolts that hold the fence, set the fence to that line, and retighten the bolts. That’s the fence setting that is parallel with that blade. You can move the fence normally to vary the width of your cut as needed. If your saw doesn’t have a fence, you can buy aftermarket ones or simply clamp a straight piece of wood to the table.

## Cutting Curves with a Band Saw

Start by matching the blade to the curve. Then, follow these tips:

1.  For very tight ones, use a narrower blade. However, too narrow a blade can make it hard to cut a shallower curve and leave a fair surface.
2.  When cutting, keep up a light, steady feed rate on the workpiece, turning it along the blade as needed. Stopping to readjust your approach won’t make a smooth cut.
3.  It’s best to try to cut just to the line. Staying outside it a little is fine as you can finish the curve by sanding it. If you end up inside the line, that’s harder to fix.
4.  For tight cuts, it helps to make a series of relief cuts first, that is, cuts that go “perpendicular” to the curve, and right up to the layout. As you cut the curve and pass through the relief cuts, the scrap falls away and gives the back of the blade room to move.

The more you use a band saw, the more versatile you’ll find it, and the better you’ll become with it.

## Safety
* Safety stuff - TBD

## A note about the guide bearing and blade shims
*   Bearing MUST be located just behind the blade. Barely skimming when not cutting:

*   Lower blade shims should be just barely gliding along blade, not forcing it left or right:

*  Same with the upper blad shims:

*  Excessive cut on back of blade shims indicative of  too much pressure. As well as the rear bearing being out of place.
