## Welcome to the Red Mountain Makers Wiki
Our mission as a technical cooperative is to engage in scientific and artistic research, experimentation, and education. To do so, we are adapting a workspace for a collaborative and supportive community of peer and project based education related to technology and artistic expression. We also support the use and development of free and opensource software, hardware and design.
