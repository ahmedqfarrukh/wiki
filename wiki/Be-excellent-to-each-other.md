Be excellent to each other
==========================

Being an asshole is most heinous! Be excellent, dudes and dudettes!

### Ways to be excellent

*   Clean up after yourself when you leave. Put your project in your storage bin, throw away any scrap materials, throw away your empty food containers, etc.
*   Put tools back where you got them. If you got them from a random spot on a table, put it where it belongs.
*   Do not be mean to people
*   Remember that inattention is more likely to be the cause of something you consider un-excellent than malice... and act accordingly.
